# Alien Upgrades On Scoreboard
Display your and your alien teammates' upgrades on the scoreboard. A mod for Natural Selection 2.  
Its Steam Workshop ID is [38543d2a](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=945044778).  
For code, questions, and bug reports, please visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/keatsandyeats/AlienUpgradesOnScoreboard).

## Usage
Put it on your server.  
If your **server doesn't have NS2+**, all aliens will see each other's upgrades on the scoreboard.  
If your **server has NS2+**, a toggle will be added to each client's NS2+ options menu. Later playing on a server without NS2+ will reset the option to default, which is to hide the upgrades.

## Compatibility
This mod **fully replaces GUIScoreboard.lua**. (I tried to work around it but failed. Sorry.) If you have other conflicting mods, let me know which and I might change the priority or solve the conflict somehow.  

Known compatible mods include:  
* NS2+
* Shine
* NSL Mod & NSL Comp Mod
