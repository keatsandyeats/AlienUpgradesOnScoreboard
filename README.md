## Usage
Put it on your server.  
If your **server doesn't have NS2+**, all aliens will see each other's upgrades on the scoreboard.  
If your **server has NS2+**, a toggle will be added to each client's NS2+ options menu. Later playing on a server without NS2+ will reset the option to default, which is to hide the upgrades.

## Compatibility
This mod places the new icons into each player's IconTable (where vanilla places the icons for Steam friend, voice muted, and chat muted).
In vanilla, IconTable is the same size for each player. This mod relies on that being true. 
If your server adds a different number of entries to each player's IconTable, this mod is going to have a bad time.
Changing the size of IconTable is fine, as long as it's the same size for each player.
